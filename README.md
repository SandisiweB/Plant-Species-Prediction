# Iris Species Classification

## Introduction

**The Iris Dataset**

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. You can learn more about this dataset here and [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html.)

## Objectives

- Use Scikit Learn to build a simple classification Machine Learning model.
- Understand the use of the random forest algorithm.
